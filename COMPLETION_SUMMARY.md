## Issue 1: Emoji Reactions Bug Fix

### Problem
- Users had to refresh the page to see emoji reactions after adding them
- WebSocket was not broadcasting reaction events
- Frontend was reloading all messages unnecessarily

### Solution Implemented
1. **Backend Changes** (`/backend/routes/messages.js`)
   - Modified POST `/:id/reactions` endpoint
   - Added channel_id lookup from message
   - Now emits `new_reaction` WebSocket event to all channel members
   - Includes updated reactions array with emoji and count

2. **Frontend Changes** (`/frontend/src/components/ChannelView.jsx`)
   - Added `handleNewReaction` function
   - Listens for `new_reaction` WebSocket events
   - Updates message reactions in local state without refetching
   - Removed `loadMessages()` call after adding reaction

### Result
âœ… Emoji reactions now appear instantly for all users in the channel
âœ… No page refresh required
âœ… Real-time synchronization via WebSocket

---

## Issue 2: Direct Messages Implementation

### Problem
- Application only supported channel-based messaging
- No way to have 1-on-1 conversations
- Missing essential Slack-like feature

### Solution Implemented

#### Backend Updates
1. **Added GET `/api/users` endpoint** (`/backend/routes/users.js`)
   - Lists all users except current user
   - Used for finding users to start DMs
   - Returns id, username, display_name, avatar_url, status

#### Frontend Components Created
1. **DirectMessageView.jsx** (190 lines)
   - Displays 1-on-1 conversation with a user
   - Shows user avatar, name, and online/offline status
   - Real-time message sending via API
   - WebSocket integration for instant message delivery
   - Reuses Message component for consistent UI
   - Empty state for no messages

2. **DirectMessageList.jsx** (200 lines)
   - Shows list of all active DM conversations
   - Displays last message and timestamp
   - Online/offline status indicators
   - "New DM" button opens user search modal
   - Search users by name or username
   - Click conversation to open DM view

3. **Updated Workspace.jsx**
   - Added view state toggle ('channels' or 'dms')
   - Integrated DirectMessageList in left sidebar
   - Shows DirectMessageView when DM selected
   - Added "Channels" and "DMs" buttons in header
   - Dynamic header based on current view
   - Maintains all existing channel functionality

#### Services Updated
4. **Updated services/api.js**
   - Fixed dmAPI.send() to use POST `/api/direct-messages` with data object
   - Fixed dmAPI.getMessages() to use `/api/direct-messages/user/:userId`
   - Added dmAPI.update() and delete()
   - Added usersAPI.getAll(), getById(), search()

5. **Updated services/socket.js**
   - Modified sendDirectMessage to accept full data object
   - Maintains compatibility with existing WebSocket handlers

#### Styling
6. **Updated App.css** (350+ lines of new CSS)
   - Complete styling for DM list and view
   - User list modal with search
   - Status indicators (online/offline dots)
   - User avatars with initials
   - View toggle buttons
   - Responsive layout for DM sidebar
   - Hover states and transitions

### Result
âœ… Complete direct messaging functionality
âœ… User search and discovery
âœ… Real-time message delivery via WebSocket
âœ… Online/offline status tracking
âœ… List of active conversations
âœ… Seamless integration with existing UI
