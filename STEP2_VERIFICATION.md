## Known Limitations (Non-Blocking)

### Mobile Navigation ⚠️
- **Issue**: No hamburger menu for mobile devices
- **Impact**: Limited channel switching on mobile
- **Priority**: Medium (future enhancement)
- **Status**: Not blocking MVP launch

### Direct Messages ⚠️

- **Backend**: APIs implemented
- **Impact**: Feature not accessible to users
- **Priority**: Medium (future enhancement)

### Production Server ℹ️
- **Current**: Using `vite preview` (not production-grade)
- **Recommended**: Use nginx or proper Node.js server for production
- **Impact**: Minor - works well for MVP/testing
- **Priority**: Low (optimization)
