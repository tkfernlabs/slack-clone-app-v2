# CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

## Current Issues (Run Started: 2025-09-30 - NEW USER FEEDBACK)

### 1. ✅ DM REACTIONS NOT SHOWING IMMEDIATELY - **RESOLVED**
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Description**: When adding a reaction to a direct message, it doesn't appear immediately without refresh
**User Report**: "when I put a reaction on a direct message I don't see it immediately"
**Resolution**:
- ✅ Fixed emoji handler signature mismatch in MessageNew component (was passing messageId twice)
- ✅ Added optimistic UI update to DirectMessageView for immediate reaction display
- ✅ Backend WebSocket events already working correctly (`dm_reaction` emitted to user rooms)
- ✅ Frontend WebSocket listener already in place
- ✅ Reactions now appear instantly when added without page refresh
**Testing**: User can add reactions to DMs and see them appear immediately
**Status**: FIXED and committed (commit 3c6bee1)
