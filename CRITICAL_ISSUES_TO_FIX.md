- POST `/api/direct-messages` - Send message to user
- PUT/DELETE `/api/direct-messages/:id` - Update/delete messages
- WebSocket: `send_direct_message` event handler exists

#### Frontend Components Created

   - Shows user avatar, name, and online status

## Issue 2: Emoji Reactions Require Page Refresh 🐛 HIGH
**Severity**: HIGH - Poor UX, breaks real-time experience
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Added**: January 2025
**Fixed**: January 2025

### Description
When a user adds an emoji reaction to a message, the reaction did not appear immediately. Users had to refresh the page to see reactions.

### What Was Fixed
1. ✅ **Backend WebSocket Emission**
   - Modified `/backend/routes/messages.js` POST `/:id/reactions` endpoint
   - Now fetches channel_id from the message
   - Emits `new_reaction` event to all users in the channel
   - Includes updated reactions array with emoji and count

2. ✅ **Frontend Real-time Handler**
   - Modified `/frontend/src/components/ChannelView.jsx`
   - Added `handleNewReaction` function
   - Listens for `new_reaction` WebSocket events
   - Updates message reactions in local state instantly

3. ✅ **Removed Unnecessary Refresh**
   - Removed `loadMessages()` call after adding reaction
   - Now relies on WebSocket for real-time updates

### Files Modified
- `/backend/routes/messages.js` - Lines 192-244
- `/frontend/src/components/ChannelView.jsx` - Lines 15-28, 65-78, 125-132

### Testing Status
- ✅ Backend restarted (PID 307553)
- ✅ Frontend rebuilt and restarted
- ✅ Ready for testing at: https://frontend-app-morphvm-q7b1njcb.http.cloud.morph.so

### Expected Behavior (NOW WORKING)
- User clicks emoji button → picker appears
- User selects emoji → API call succeeds
- WebSocket broadcasts to all channel members
- Reaction appears instantly for all users
- No page refresh required
