**Last Updated**: January 30, 2025 10:17 AM
**Status**: 🎉 2/3 FIXED - 1 issue remaining (Direct Messages)

## Issue 1: Direct Messages (DMs) Support Missing 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY
**Severity**: HIGH - Core feature missing
**Status**: 🚧 NOT FIXED - Needs implementation
**Added**: January 30, 2025

### Description
The application currently lacks direct message (1-on-1) functionality. Users should be able to send private messages to other users outside of channels.

### Required Implementation

#### Backend Requirements
- [ ] Create/verify `direct_messages` table in database
- [ ] GET `/api/users` - List all users (for DM recipient selection)
- [ ] GET `/api/direct-messages/conversations` - List all DM conversations
- [ ] GET `/api/direct-messages/user/:userId` - Get messages with specific user
- [ ] POST `/api/direct-messages` - Send message to user
- [ ] WebSocket: `send_direct_message` event handler for real-time delivery

#### Frontend Requirements
- [ ] DirectMessageView component - Display DM conversation
- [ ] DirectMessageList component - Show list of conversations
- [ ] User selection modal for starting new DMs
- [ ] Integration into Workspace component
- [ ] Real-time message updates via WebSocket
- [ ] CSS styling for DM interface

### Expected Behavior
- Users can click "DMs" button to switch to direct messages view
- Click "+" or "New DM" to see list of all users
- Search/select user to start conversation
- Send messages in real-time
- Receive messages via WebSocket instantly
- See list of all active conversations

### Priority
**HIGH** - Critical feature for chat application

## Issue 2: Emoji Reactions - Button Not Visible 🐛 HIGH PRIORITY
**Severity**: HIGH - Feature exists but UI is not visible
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Added**: January 30, 2025
**Fixed**: January 30, 2025 10:17 AM

### Solution Implemented
Created a brand new `MessageNew.jsx` component with inline styles to ensure the emoji reaction button is always visible.

### What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Created `/frontend/src/components/MessageNew.jsx` with:
   - Always-visible "😊 React" button with inline styles
   - Emoji picker popup with 6 common emojis (👍 ❤️ 😊 🎉 🚀 👀)
   - Proper z-index and positioning
   - Clean, simple implementation

2. ✅ Updated `/frontend/src/components/ChannelView.jsx`:
   - Changed import from `./Message` to `./MessageNew`

3. ✅ Rebuilt frontend and restarted server

### Testing Results
- ✅ Emoji "React" button visible below every message
- ✅ Clicking button opens emoji picker
- ✅ Selecting emoji adds reaction immediately
- ✅ WebSocket broadcasts reaction to all users
- ✅ Reaction appears WITHOUT page refresh
- ✅ Console confirms: "Reaction added successfully" and "Received new reaction via WebSocket"

### Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/components/MessageNew.jsx` - NEW (142 lines)
- `/frontend/src/components/ChannelView.jsx` - Updated import

### Commit
- ✅ Committed: `364d4b6` - "✅ FIX: Emoji reactions now working - created MessageNew component with visible React button"

### Priority
**COMPLETE** ✅ - Issue fully resolved and tested

## Issue 3: Workspace Creation Fails in Frontend 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY
**Severity**: HIGH - Core functionality broken
**Status**: ✅ ACTUALLY WORKS - No fix needed!
**Added**: January 30, 2025
**Resolved**: January 30, 2025

### Investigation Results
During testing, workspace creation was found to be **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**.

### Testing Performed
1. ✅ Clicked "+ WORKSPACES" button in sidebar
2. ✅ Modal opened with form fields (name and description)
3. ✅ Entered "Test Issue Workspace" as name
4. ✅ Entered "Testing workspace creation functionality" as description
5. ✅ Clicked "Create Workspace" button
6. ✅ New workspace appeared in sidebar at the top!
7. ✅ Default #general channel was created automatically
8. ✅ User was added to the workspace

### Conclusion
**This was a FALSE ALARM** - workspace creation works perfectly. No code changes needed.

### Backend Implementation (Verified Working)
- POST `/api/workspaces` endpoint functional
- Creates workspace with unique slug
- Adds creator as admin member
- Creates default #general channel
- Adds creator to the channel

### Priority
**RESOLVED** ✅ - Feature works correctly, no action needed
