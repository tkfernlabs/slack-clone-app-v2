### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è DM REACTIONS REAL-TIME FUNCTIONALITY - **NEEDS TESTING**

**Current Implementation**:

## Testing Recommendations
To fully verify issue #3, test with two different users:
1. User A sends a DM to User B
2. User B adds a reaction to the DM
3. Verify User A sees the reaction immediately without refresh
