# CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

## Issue 1: White Screen After Workspace/Channel Creation ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH - Breaks user experience
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (2025-09-30)
**Commit**: c1bdc82
**Observed**: Multiple times during testing
**Resolution**: Fixed response destructuring in WorkspaceContext.jsx

### Description
After creating a workspace or channel, the page shows a blank white screen. User must manually refresh (F5) to see the results.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Click "+" to create workspace
2. Fill in name and description
3. Click "Create Workspace"
4. **BUG**: Page goes blank/white
5. User must press F5 to see the new workspace

### Expected Behavior
- Modal should close
- New workspace should appear in sidebar immediately
- User should be taken to the new workspace's default channel
- No white screen should occur

### Root Cause
Likely a frontend routing or state management issue after successful API response. Possibly related to async state updates not triggering re-render.

### Priority
**URGENT** - This makes the app appear broken to users

---

## Issue 2: Messages Not Displaying After Being Sent ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH - Core functionality appears broken
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (2025-09-30)
**Tested**: ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING - Messages appear instantly without refresh

### Description
When a user sends a message, the input field clears (indicating the message was sent), but the message does not appear in the channel view. Only after refreshing the page do messages appear.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to any channel
2. Type a message in the input field
3. Click "Send" button
4. **BUG**: Input clears but no message appears in the channel
5. Refresh page (F5) to see the message

### What Was Fixed
- ✅ Message API endpoints added to `/api/channels/:id/messages`
- ✅ Backend routes now properly handle GET and POST for messages
- ✅ Database column names corrected (thread_id vs parent_id)
- ✅ Messages can be retrieved via API

### What Was Fixed (Round 2)
- ✅ Backend now emits WebSocket events when messages are created via API
- ✅ Frontend Message component now handles both snake_case and camelCase field names
- ✅ Duplicate message sending removed (now only uses API, WebSocket broadcasts automatically)
- ✅ Real-time message display now working
- ✅ Messages appear immediately after sending via WebSocket broadcast

### Expected Behavior
- Message should appear immediately after clicking Send
- No page refresh required
- Real-time update via WebSocket or immediate API refresh

### Priority
**URGENT** - Users cannot have a conversation without constant refreshing

---

## Issue 3: "Unknown User" Displayed on Messages ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH - Poor user experience
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (2025-09-30)
**Tested**: ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING - User display names showing correctly ("John Smith")
**Resolution**: Message component updated to handle both flat and nested user data structures from backend

### Description
All messages in channels display "Unknown User" instead of the actual username or display name.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to any channel with messages
2. Observe message display
3. **BUG**: Shows "Unknown User" instead of "John Smith" or "johnsmith"

### Technical Details
- Backend returns: `username`, `display_name`, `avatar_url`
- Frontend Message component may be looking for different field names
- Possible mismatch between backend response and frontend expectations

### Root Cause
Frontend Message component is not correctly reading user data from the message object. Need to check:
- Field name mapping in Message.jsx
- How user data is destructured from message object
- Whether user data is being passed correctly to Message component

### Expected Behavior
- Show user's display name (e.g., "John Smith")
- Fall back to username if display name not available
- Show avatar if available

### Priority
**HIGH** - Users need to know who sent each message

---

## Issue 4: "Invalid Date" Displayed on Messages ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH - Poor user experience
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (2025-09-30)
**Tested**: ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING - Timestamps displaying correctly (e.g., "01:07 AM")
**Resolution**: formatTime function updated to handle both snake_case and camelCase timestamps with proper error handling

### Description
All messages show "Invalid Date" instead of the actual timestamp (e.g., "2:45 PM" or "5 minutes ago").

### Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to any channel with messages
2. Observe message timestamps
3. **BUG**: Shows "Invalid Date" instead of formatted time

### Technical Details
- Backend returns: `created_at` as ISO 8601 string (e.g., "2025-09-29T23:41:36.796Z")
- Frontend may not be correctly parsing the date string
- Possible issue with date formatting library or timezone handling

### Root Cause
Frontend Message component is not correctly parsing or formatting the `created_at` timestamp. Likely issues:
- Date constructor not handling ISO string properly
- Missing date formatting function
- Timezone conversion issues

### Expected Behavior
- Show relative time for recent messages ("5 minutes ago")
- Show time for today's messages ("2:45 PM")
- Show date and time for older messages ("Jan 15, 2:45 PM")

### Priority
**HIGH** - Timestamps are essential for chat context

---

## Issue 5: Frontend Build Required for Every Change ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Development workflow issue
**Status**: KNOWN LIMITATION

### Description
Every time a frontend file is changed, the entire frontend must be rebuilt and the preview server restarted for changes to take effect.

### Impact
- Slow development iteration
- No hot module replacement
- Must manually rebuild after each change

### Current Workflow
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Better Workflow Needed
- Use `npm run dev` for development with HMR
- Only use `npm run build` + `npm run preview` for production testing
- Separate development and production environments

### Priority
**MEDIUM** - Affects development speed but not end users

---

## Issue 6: CORS Warnings in Console ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Not blocking but indicates configuration issues
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Previously)
**Resolution**: Authorization header explicitly listed in CORS configuration

### Description
Browser console shows multiple CORS warnings:
```
Cross-Origin Request Warning: The Same Origin Policy will disallow reading the remote resource at https://backend-api-morphvm-q7b1njcb.http.cloud.morph.so/api/users/me soon. (Reason: When the 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' is '*', the 'Authorization' header is not covered. To include the 'Authorization' header, it must be explicitly listed in CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers').
```

### Impact
- Warnings for: `/api/users/me`, `/api/workspaces`, `/api/channels/*/messages`
- Future browser versions may block these requests
- Indicates improper CORS configuration

### Root Cause
CORS configuration uses wildcard `*` for allowed headers but browsers require explicit `Authorization` header listing.

### Fix Needed
Update CORS configuration in `backend/server.js` to explicitly list Authorization header instead of using wildcard.

### Priority
**MEDIUM** - Works now but may break in future browser versions

---

## Issue 7: WebSocket Not Broadcasting Messages ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH - Real-time functionality broken
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (2025-09-30)
**Tested**: ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING - Real-time message broadcasting functional
**Resolution**: Added WebSocket emission in channels.js POST /:id/messages endpoint. Backend now broadcasts via WebSocket when messages are created. Middleware added to attach io object to all requests.

### Description
Messages sent via the frontend do not appear in real-time. WebSocket may not be properly broadcasting new messages to connected clients.

### Symptoms
- Message sent successfully via API
- Message stored in database
- Message does NOT appear without page refresh
- Other users would not see the message in real-time

### Verification Needed
- Check if WebSocket connection is established
- Check if 'new_message' events are being emitted
- Check if frontend is listening for 'new_message' events
- Test with multiple users/tabs

### Expected Behavior
- Message appears immediately for sender
- Message appears immediately for all users in the channel
- No page refresh required

### Priority
**HIGH** - Essential for real-time chat experience

---

## Issue 8: Message Component Not Receiving User Data Correctly ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Display issue
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (2025-09-30)
**Resolution**: Fixed along with Issues #3 and #4

### Description
The Message component is not correctly extracting and displaying user information from the message object.

### Fields Returned by Backend
```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "channel_id": 11,
  "user_id": 5,
  "content": "Hello!",
  "username": "johnsmith",
  "display_name": "John Smith",
  "avatar_url": null,
  "created_at": "2025-09-29T23:41:36.796Z"
}
```

### What's Displayed
- Username: "Unknown User"
- Timestamp: "Invalid Date"

### Root Cause
Message.jsx component is either:
1. Not receiving the user fields from parent
2. Using incorrect property names to access user data
3. Not handling null/undefined values properly

### Files to Check
- `/frontend/src/components/Message.jsx`
- How message prop is passed from ChannelView
- Field name mapping

### Priority
**MEDIUM** - Functional but looks unprofessional

---

## Issue 9: No Loading States During Operations ⚠️ LOW
**Severity**: LOW - UX enhancement
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED

- Disable buttons during operations

### Priority
**LOW** - Enhancement, not blocking

---

## Issue 10: Error Handling is Generic ⚠️ LOW
**Severity**: LOW - UX enhancement
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Description
Error messages are generic (e.g., "Failed to send message") instead of showing specific error details from backend.

### Examples
- "Failed to send message" - why? Network error? Permission denied?
- "Failed to create workspace" - what went wrong?

### Expected Behavior
- Show specific error messages from backend
- Provide actionable guidance (e.g., "Channel name already exists")
- Different UI for different error types (network vs validation vs permission)

### Priority
**LOW** - Enhancement for better UX

---

## Issue 11: No Channel Description Display in Channel List ℹ️ LOW
**Severity**: LOW - Feature missing
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Description
Channel list in sidebar shows channel names but not descriptions. Users can't see what each channel is for without clicking.

### Expected Behavior
- Show channel description on hover
- Or show truncated description below channel name
- Help users understand channel purpose before joining

### Priority
**LOW** - Nice to have

---

## Issue 12: No User Avatar Display 👤 LOW  
**Severity**: LOW - Visual enhancement
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Description
Messages show a "?" placeholder instead of user avatars. Avatar functionality not implemented.

### Current State

## Issue 21: Frontend Needs Proper Production Deployment 🚀 HIGH
**Severity**: HIGH - Deployment concern
**Status**: NEEDS ATTENTION

### Current State
- Frontend running with `npm run preview`
- This is NOT a production server
- Preview server is for testing builds locally

### Issue
From Vite docs: "vite preview is intended for previewing the build locally and not meant as a production server."

### Proper Production Deployment Needed
- Deploy to proper static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages)
- Or use proper Node.js production server (Express serving static files)
- Configure proper production environment variables
- Set up CDN for assets

### Current Setup Issues
- Preview server not designed for production traffic
- No proper process management
- No automatic restarts
- No load balancing

### Priority
**HIGH** - Current setup not suitable for production

---

- ✅ Backend .env file in .gitignore

### Current Setup
- Frontend uses `VITE_API_URL` and `VITE_WS_URL` environment variables
- Backend uses `.env` file for sensitive data (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET)
- All sensitive data properly isolated to backend

### Priority
**HIGH** - Security verified

---

## Issue 23: No Rate Limiting on API 🛡️ MEDIUM

**Severity**: LOW - Development workflow
**STATUS**: AD-HOC MIGRATIONS

### Description
Database schema changes done ad-hoc without proper migration tracking.

### Current Approach
- Manual SQL via Neon tool
- `prepare_database_migration` used once
- No version control of schema

### Better Approach Needed
- Use proper migration tool (Prisma, TypeORM, Knex)
- Version control all migrations
- Easy rollback capability
- Team synchronization

### Priority
**LOW** - Development workflow, not user-facing

---

- **LOW**: 8 issues

### By Status
- **NOT FIXED**: 17 issues
- **PARTIALLY FIXED**: 2 issues
- **NOT TESTED**: 4 issues
- **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: 2 issues

### Must Fix Before Production
1. White screen after creation (Issue #1)
2. Messages not appearing immediately (Issue #2)
3. Unknown User display (Issue #3)
4. Invalid Date display (Issue #4)
5. Proper frontend deployment (Issue #21)

---

## Notes
The workspace creation functionality works at the API level (verified with curl), but the frontend integration has critical UX issues that make the app unusable. These must be fixed before the application can be considered production-ready.

**Message sending works at API level** - confirmed messages are stored in database and can be retrieved, but real-time display and WebSocket integration need fixing.
